# Three Body Problem

Use SDL2, Boost 1.83 and CMake to make a simple simulation of the classic three-body-problem.

## Building

Requirements:
* Boost (1.84 is used but can be changed in CMakeLists.txt).
* SDL2 (2.30.2 is used but can be changed in CMakeLists.txt).

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:cschladetsch/ThreeBodyProblem.git
$ cd ThreeBodyProblem
$ mkdir build && cd build && cmake ..
$ # At this point, it depends on your platform.
```

## Notes

This was hacked together in a couple hours. YMMV. 

The only source file is [main.cpp](#main.cpp).
